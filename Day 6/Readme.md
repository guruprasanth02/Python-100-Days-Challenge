# 🌟 Day 6: The Secure Login Program 🔐

### 🎊 Today’s Highlights:

* **Login Authentication:** We learned how to create a secure login system by validating both the username and password.
* **Conditional Logic:** We used if, elif, and else statements to check different conditions for different users and ensure correct logins.
* **Personalized Greetings:** Based on the username and password, we implemented specific personalized greetings for users, and a default response for anyone who isn't authorized.

### 🔍 Key Concepts:

* **If Statements:** Used to check if the username and password match the given values.
* **Elif Statements:** Allowed for checking multiple conditions between if and else.
* **Else Statements:** Provided a default response for users who fail to meet the login criteria.
* **Indentation:** Ensured proper indentation for code blocks to ensure the logic works correctly.

### 👉 Day 6 Challenge: Secure Login Program
Task Overview:

* Create a login program where users need to enter both a username and a password. If the username and password match, a personalized greeting will be displayed.
* Add personalized greetings for 3 different people.
* Include an else statement to deny access for anyone who doesn't meet the criteria.

### 🛠️ Common Errors Encountered:
1. **Indentation Errors:**

   * Make sure if, elif, and else blocks are properly indented. Each statement block must align with the others for the program to execute correctly.
  
2. **Comparison Errors:**

   * Always use == for comparisons, not =, as = is for assignment in Python.

3. **Missing Quotes:**

   * Remember that both string inputs (from input()) and string comparisons need to be enclosed in quotes.

4. **Incorrect Password Handling:**

   * Ensure each user has a unique password associated with their username. Don't forget to check both username and password when verifying login credentials.
