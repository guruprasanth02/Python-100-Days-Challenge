# üåü Day 75: Creating Your Own Link Tree Website üåêüì±

### üéä Today‚Äôs Highlights:

* **Building a Link Tree:** Today, you‚Äôll create a link tree website that serves as a portfolio and a way to showcase all your online work, social media, and projects in one place.
* **One Link to Rule Them All:** A link tree allows you to share a single link in your social profiles, keeping all of your resources and examples of your work updated and accessible from one location.

Your link tree will include:

  1. A **picture** of yourself at the top.
  2. Your **name** and **social media** handles for easy access.
  3. A set of **headings** that link to your work, profiles, and any other content you're proud of.

**Example Layout:**

* **Header:** Picture of yourself + Name

* **Links:** 

    * LinkedIn Profile
    * Portfolio Website
    * GitHub Repository
    * Twitter
    * Instagram

This setup allows you to have a polished, professional place to direct people to your work with minimal effort on your part.
