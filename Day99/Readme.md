### 🔍 Key Concepts:

* **Filtering:** Identify events that match specific topics of interest (e.g., Python, Web Development, Machine Learning).

* **Scheduling:** Set up a periodic scheduler to run the scraping task every 6 hours.

* **Email Automation:** Send an email with a link to the event whenever a new event is found.

### 👉 Day 99 Challenge: Task Overview:

* **Scrape Events:** Scrape events from the Replit Community Hub for topics of interest.

* **Filter Events:** Only focus on events that are related to specific topics of interest.

* **Schedule Scrape:** Set up a scheduler to scrape every 6 hours.

* **Avoid Redundant Emails:** Ensure you only email new events that haven't been sent previously.

### 🛠️ Implementation Details:

* **Scraping Events:** Use ```requests``` and ```BeautifulSoup``` to fetch and parse event data from the Replit Community Hub.

* **Filtering Events:** Use string matching or regular expressions to filter events based on topic keywords like "Python", "Web Development", or "Machine Learning".

* **Scheduling Scrape:** Use a scheduler like ```schedule``` or ```APScheduler``` to run the scraping task at regular intervals (every 6 hours).

* **Emailing Events:** Use ```smtplib``` or a service like ```SendGrid``` to send emails. Include a hyperlink to the event in the email body.

### 🛠️ Common Errors Encountered:

* **Web Scraping Issues:** The Replit Community Hub's structure may change, leading to errors in the scraping process.

    * **Fix:** Regularly inspect the structure and update the scraping logic accordingly.

* **Email Handling:** Sending emails may require correct configuration of SMTP or email service APIs.

     * **Fix:** Double-check the authentication and email format to avoid issues with email delivery.

* **Scheduling Conflicts:** The script may overlap or fail to run due to scheduling issues.

     * **Fix:** Test the scheduling function to ensure it works consistently over long periods.
