# 🌟 Day 21: Multiplication Table Quiz 🧮✨

### 🎊 Today’s Highlights:

* **User Input Handling:** We learned how to prompt users for their multiplication tables and handle their input.
* **Loops & Logic:** We applied loops to generate multiplication tables and conditionals to check if the answers were correct.
* **Scoring System:** A scoring mechanism was built to keep track of how many math facts the user got right.
* **Feedback & Fun:** Depending on the user's performance, we gave positive feedback and added a fun emoji if they scored a perfect score.

### 🔍 Key Concepts:

* **User Input:** We prompted the user for the number they want the multiplication table for, and then asked them to solve each multiplication fact from 1 to 10.
* **Loops:** We used a loop to generate the multiplication table for each round, ensuring the game was dynamic and interactive.
* **Conditional Logic:** We checked whether the user’s answer was correct or not using if/else statements.
* **Scoring System:** We kept track of the user's score and displayed it at the end of the game.
* **Interactive Feedback:** Based on the user’s answer, we displayed a message to either congratulate them or correct their mistake.

### 👉 Day 21 Challenge: Multiplication Table Quiz Task Overview: Write a program that:

1. Prompts the user to enter a number of their choice for the multiplication table.
2. Asks the user to solve the multiplication facts for that number, from 1 to 10.
3. For each math fact:
     * If the user answers correctly, award them a point.
     * If they answer incorrectly, no points are awarded, and the correct answer is shown.
4. After 10 rounds, display the user's score out of 10.
5. If the user answers all questions correctly, give them a fun emoji!

### 🛠️ Common Errors Encountered:

* **Invalid Input:** If the user enters non-numeric characters when prompted for answers, it could cause the program to crash.

    **Fix:** We ensured that the user input is always converted to an integer with proper error handling.

* **Incorrect Logic for Scoring:** If the scoring system wasn't implemented properly, users could get an incorrect final score.

    **Fix:** We used a simple counter (score) to keep track of correct answers.

* **Incorrect Display of Results:** If the result isn't formatted correctly, the score might be unclear.

    **Fix:** We made sure to clearly display the user’s score at the end of the quiz.



**Keep coding and have fun while testing your multiplication skills!** 🧮✨
