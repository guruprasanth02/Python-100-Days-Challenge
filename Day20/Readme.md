# 🌟 Day 20: List Generator 📋

### 🎊 Today’s Highlights:
- **User Input**: We asked the user to input a starting number, ending number, and increment value to generate a sequence of numbers.
- **Range Function**: We learned how to use Python's `range()` function to generate a sequence of numbers based on the user’s inputs.
- **Loops**: We used a `for` loop to print each number in the generated range, showcasing how the `range()` function works with a starting point, an ending point, and an increment.
- **User Interaction**: This challenge focused on taking inputs from the user and generating a list based on those inputs.

### 🔍 Key Concepts:
- **User Input**: Collecting the starting number, ending number, and increment from the user using the `input()` function.
- **Range Function**: Understanding how the `range(start, stop, step)` function works in Python:
    - **Start**: The number where the sequence begins.
    - **Stop**: The number where the sequence ends (but does not include).
    - **Step**: The increment between each number in the sequence.
- **For Loop**: Iterating through the generated range and printing each value.

### 👉 Day 20 Challenge: List Generator Task Overview:
Write a program that:

1. Asks the user to input the starting number.
2. Asks the user to input the ending number.
3. Asks the user to input the increment (step value) between the numbers.
4. Displays the sequence based on the inputs, showing the numbers in the range, one per line.

### My Code:


### 🛠️ Common Errors Encountered:

* **Invalid Input Types:** If the user inputs a non-integer value for the start, end, or increment, the program will crash.

    **Fix:** Use int() to ensure the inputs are integers. Alternatively, add error handling to check if the input is a valid number.

* **Incorrect Range:** If the ending value is less than the starting value and the increment is positive, the range will be empty and nothing will be printed.

    **Fix:** Validate the inputs to ensure that the range makes sense (e.g., starting value is less than ending value if the increment is positive).

* **Negative Increments:** If the increment is negative, the program should count backward. If not handled correctly, it may result in an unexpected output.

   **Fix:** Ensure the program correctly handles both positive and negative increments, and validate that the starting and ending values are appropriate for the direction of counting.

🎉 Celebrate Your Success! Great job exploring Python’s range() function and using user inputs to generate a list! You can now generate custom sequences of numbers based on any criteria the user sets!

**Happy Coding!** 💻
