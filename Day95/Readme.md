# üåü Day 95: Daily Track Generator Challenge üé∂üíª

### üéä Today‚Äôs Highlights:

* **News Story Collection:** We fetch the five most recent news stories in your area (or category of choice) to generate a daily track list.

* **Summary Generation:** OpenAI is used to summarize the news stories into two to three key words.

* **Spotify Integration:** We use these keywords to search Spotify and retrieve song recommendations based on those summaries.

* **Song Samples:** Display song names, their related search prompt words, and a link to a sample of each track for listening.

### üîç Key Concepts:

* **News Fetching:** Using an API (or scraping, if APIs are not available) to gather the latest news stories in the specified area or category.

* **Summarization with OpenAI:** OpenAI's language model is used to generate short summaries from each of the news stories.

* **Spotify API Integration:** We use the Spotify Web API to search for songs based on the keywords.

* **Sample Link Generation:** The program includes a URL for each track so the user can listen to a sample of each song.

### üëâ Day 95 Challenge:

**Task Overview:**

  * Fetch the most recent news stories (5 stories) from your area or a chosen category.
  
  * Use OpenAI to summarize each story into 2-3 words.

  * Use the keywords from OpenAI to search Spotify for matching tracks.

  * Display the name of each track, the search prompt words used, and a link to sample the track.

### üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details:

* **News Fetching:** You'll use a news API (e.g., NewsAPI) to pull in the most recent stories.

* **OpenAI Summarization:** Each story's summary is generated by sending the full text to OpenAI‚Äôs language model and requesting a concise 2-3 word summary.

* **Spotify Search:** With the generated summary, query the Spotify API to search for related tracks.

* **Sample Links:** After obtaining track information, provide a link to a preview of the song on Spotify.

### üõ†Ô∏è Common Errors Encountered:

* **API Rate Limits:** NewsAPI and Spotify both have rate limits. Make sure to handle API response errors and retry if necessary.

    * **Fix:** Implement rate limiting or retries using exponential backoff or similar methods.

* **Search Mismatch:** The keywords generated might not always match perfect tracks on Spotify.

    * **Fix:** If no results are found, fallback to a default or general genre-based track suggestion.

* **API Authentication Errors:** Spotify API requires an access token for use.

    * **Fix:** Make sure to authenticate properly with OAuth before making requests.
