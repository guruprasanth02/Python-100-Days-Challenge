# üåü Day 69: Visual Novel Creation Challenge üéÆüìñ

### üéä Today‚Äôs Highlights:

* **Visual Novel Basics:** We learned the core structure of a visual novel, including creating a branching story with multiple decisions and endings.
* **User Interaction:** We incorporated buttons for users to make choices that influence the story‚Äôs progression.
* **Simple Branching Logic:** The novel features two main branches, one of which leads to an unhappy ending, while the other includes both a bad and a good ending.
* **Story Flow:** We built a story where the user‚Äôs choices determine which images and text are displayed, creating an interactive experience.

### üîç Key Concepts:

* **Interactive Storytelling:** A visual novel involves presenting choices to the player, where each decision they make alters the path and outcome of the story.
* **Branching Paths:** We created two main branches of the story, with decisions leading to different endings (unhappy, bad, and good).
* **Buttons for Choices:** We used buttons for players to select their choices, making the experience interactive and dynamic.
* **Story Resetting:** Each ending (whether bad or good) includes a "start again" button to let the user restart the visual novel.

### üëâ Day 69 Challenge: Visual Novel Task Overview:

**Create a simple visual novel with two main decisions:**

* **Introduction & Decision 1:** Begin with an image and a short text. Provide two options for the player to choose from. Each choice will lead to a different branch.
* **Branch 1:** The first branch leads to an unhappy ending. Both options in this branch lead to the same result, which is not ideal, but saves time.
* **Branch 2:** The second branch has a mix of good and bad endings. One option should lead to a bad ending, while the other leads to a good ending.
* **Ending Screens:** After each ending, the user can click a "start again" button to return to the first page.

### üõ†Ô∏è Common Errors Encountered:

* **Poor Flow Control:** Sometimes it‚Äôs difficult to manage the flow between the different branches, especially when you need to ensure the right image and text appear based on the user‚Äôs choices.

  * **Fix:** Carefully track the branching logic to ensure choices lead to the correct story paths and that each choice is properly linked to a unique outcome.

* **Incorrect Button Functionality:** If buttons aren't properly linked to their actions, the story may not flow as expected.

  * **Fix:** Double-check that each button is correctly tied to its corresponding function (i.e., to either transition to a new part of the story or reset the game).

* **Lack of Dynamic Content:** Sometimes the visual novel may feel static or repetitive, with the same images or text being displayed multiple times.

  * **Fix:** Ensure the visual novel has multiple dynamic elements, like unique images or background changes depending on the player's choice.
