     * If the password is wrong, exit the program immediately.
     * If correct, enter the main menu where users can add or view diary entries.

* **Diary Entry Management:**

    * **Add an entry:** Prompt the user to input their thoughts and save them along with the current timestamp.

    * **View entries:** Display the most recent diary entry, allowing users to navigate backward through older entries. Users can exit at any time.

* **Date-based Entry Viewing:**

    * **Extra feature:** Users can view entries from a specific date.

### 🛠️ Common Errors Encountered:

* **Incorrect Password Handling:**

  Error: The program should terminate or give an error when the password is wrong.
  Fix: Use an ```if``` statement to check if the entered password matches the correct one and exit if not.

* **File Handling Issues:**

  Error: Saving or reading entries may not work if the file handling is incorrect.
  Fix: Ensure that entries are stored in a file or a dictionary with the timestamp as the key.

* **Entry Navigation Problems:**

  Error: Navigating through diary entries might be buggy if the list or dictionary is not structured well.
  Fix: Implement a clear structure for storing entries (such as a dictionary with timestamps) and iterate backward properly.

* **Date-based Viewing Errors:**

  Error: Searching for a specific date might not work correctly.
  Fix: Ensure the program can match dates properly and display the corresponding entry.

**Enjoy building your secure and private digital diary! 🚀**
