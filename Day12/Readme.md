# 🌟 Day 12: 100 Days of Code Quiz Challenge 📚

### 🎊 Today’s Highlights:

* **User Input:** We prompted the user for input to create a quiz-like experience.
* **Conditionals:** Used if-else logic to check if the user’s responses were correct, guiding them based on their answers.
* **String Comparison:** Learned how to compare strings case-insensitively using .lower().
* **Integer Handling:** Handled user input for numeric questions and used int() to ensure comparisons with integers.
* **Debugging:** Solved common issues like missing quotes, improper string assignment, and incorrect conditionals.

### 🔍 Key Concepts:

* **User Input:** Getting input from the user for both string and numeric questions.
* **Conditionals:** Using if, elif, and else to handle different responses and guide the user accordingly.
* **String Methods:** Applied .lower() to make string comparison case-insensitive.
* **Integer Conversion:** Using int() to convert string input into integers for numerical comparison.

### 👉 Day 12 Challenge: Build a Quiz
Task Overview:

* Write a program that:

    * Asks two quiz questions.
    * Uses conditionals to check if the answers are correct or not.
    * Handles string and integer inputs correctly.

### 🛠️ Common Errors Encountered:

1. **Input Handling:** The input() function must be used to get responses from the user. Avoid assigning strings directly to variables like ans1 = "What language are we writing in?".
2. **String Comparison:** Make sure string comparisons are case-insensitive using .lower() to avoid mismatches like "Python" and "python".
3. **Integer Conversion:** For numeric answers, convert the input to an integer using int() before comparing.
4. **Indentation:** Ensure proper indentation when using if, elif, and else statements.
