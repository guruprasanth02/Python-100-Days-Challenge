# 🌟 Day 81: I'm Not a Robot Program Challenge 🤖

### 🎊 Today’s Highlights:

* **Robot Detection:** Create a program with tricky questions to distinguish humans from robots.
* **User Interaction:** Prompt the user with a set of questions and handle their responses.
* **Answer Verification:** Use logic to check for human-like responses and display the result.

### 🔍 Key Concepts:

* **Question Formats:**

  * Yes/No Radio Button Question
  * Free Text Question
  * Drop-down Question
    
* **User Input Handling:**

  * Process radio button selections, free text input, and drop-down choices.

* **Conditional Logic:**

   * Use logic to check responses and identify robot-like behavior.

### 👉 Day 81 Challenge: I'm Not a Robot Program Overview

Write a program that:

* **Displays at least three tricky questions** designed to identify robots.
* One question should require a **Yes/No answer** using a radio button format.
* One question should allow **free text input**.
* One question should involve a **drop-down menu** with predefined options.
* Based on the user's answers, display either:
  
    * **"You're a robot"**
    * **"Not a robot"**

**Example Questions:**

* **Are you made of metal?** (Yes/No)
* **Were you constructed by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation?** (Free text)
* **Do you dream of being ED-209 when you grow up?** (Drop-down with "Yes", "No", "Maybe")

### 🛠️ Common Errors Encountered:

* **Incorrect Input Handling:**

   * Error: Failing to properly handle user input (e.g., free text or drop-down).
   * Fix: Ensure all inputs are captured correctly and validated.

* **Logic Failures:**

   * Error: Incorrect logic to determine robot-like behavior.
   * Fix: Thoroughly check all possible answers and their implications.

* **Display Issues:**

   * Error: Incorrect output or failure to display the robot or not-robot message.
   * Fix: Ensure clear, correct feedback after input.

**Keep building and enjoy your quest to determine who’s human and who’s not! 🚀**
