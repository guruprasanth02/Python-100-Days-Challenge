# 🌟 Day 50: Idea Storage System Challenge 🧠💡

### 🎊 Today’s Highlights:

* **Idea Storage:** Build a system that stores your ideas and retrieves a random one when needed.

* **User Interaction:** Prompt users to add new ideas or load a random idea.

* **File Management:** Use a text file to save and retrieve ideas.

### 🔍 Key Concepts:

* **File Operations:**

    * Use Python's ```open()``` function in append mode to add ideas to a file.
     
    * Read ideas from the file when retrieving a random idea.

* **Random Selection:** Use ```random.choice()``` to select an idea from the list.

* **User-Friendly Menu:** Create a simple, interactive menu to guide the user through the options.

### 👉 Day 50 Challenge: Idea Storage System Overview

**Write a program that:**

1. Displays a menu asking the user to:

      * Add a new idea.
   
      * Load a random idea.

3. If the user chooses to add an idea:

      * Prompt them for their idea.
        
      * Save it to a text file called ```my.ideas``` in append mode, ensuring each idea is on a new line.

5. If the user chooses to load a random idea:

      * Read all ideas from the ```my.ideas``` file.
      
      * Randomly select one and display it briefly.
      
      * Return to the main menu.

### 🛠️ Common Errors Encountered:

1. **File Not Found:**

      * Error: Trying to read ```my.ideas``` before it exists.
      * **Fix:** Check if the file exists before reading. If not, create it.

2. **Empty File for Random Selection:**

      * Error: Attempting to load a random idea from an empty file.
      * **Fix:** Add a check to ensure the file has content before selecting an idea.

3. **Incorrect Append Logic:**

      * Error: Overwriting the file instead of appending ideas.
      * **Fix:** Use ```open('my.ideas', 'a')``` to append instead of overwriting.

4. **Random Selection Issues:**

      * Error: ```random.choice()``` failing due to an empty list.
      * **Fix:** Handle the case where no ideas are stored and notify the user.
