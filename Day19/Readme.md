# 🌟 Day 19: Loan Calculator Challenge 💰📊

### 🎊 Today’s Highlights:

* **For Loops for Repetition:** We learned how to use a for loop to repeat a task a set number of times.
* **Range Function:** We utilized the range() function to specify how many times the loop should run, and we set it to run over 10 years.
* **Loan Calculation:** We calculated how much money will be owed on a loan after adding interest yearly at a 5% APR (Annual Percentage Rate).
* **Simple Code Structure:** The task was solved with just a few lines of code to show how powerful loops can be in solving real-world problems.

### 👉 Day 19 Challenge: Loan Calculator Task Overview:

* Objective: You are asked to calculate how much a loan of $1,000 will grow to over 10 years with a 5% annual interest rate.
* Steps:
     1. Use a for loop to repeat the interest calculation over 10 years.
     2. In each loop iteration, increase the loan amount by 5%.
     3. Print the loan amount for each year and display the final amount owed after 10 years.
* Hint: This is a straightforward task where you don’t need to overcomplicate things. Just use one or two lines of code in the loop!

### 🛠️ Common Errors Encountered:

* **Incorrect Loop Range:** Forgetting to set the correct range for the number of years (e.g., using range(10) instead of range(1, 11)) can result in missing the last year in the calculation.

     **Fix:** Use range(1, 11) to include years 1 through 10.

* **Misunderstanding the Interest Calculation:** It's important to correctly calculate the interest by multiplying the loan amount by the interest rate each year.

     **Fix:** Ensure that you update the loan_amount each year by adding the interest to the current amount.

* **Missing Print Statement:** Forgetting to print out the loan amount for each year might leave you without visible results in the output.

     **Fix:** Use the print() function to display the updated loan amount at the end of each loop iteration.

**Keep coding and enjoy learning how to apply loops to practical scenarios like this one!** 💰📊
