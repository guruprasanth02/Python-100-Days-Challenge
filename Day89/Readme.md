    * Grant delete permissions exclusively to your username to manage the chat room.

### 👉 Day 89 Challenge: Community Chat App Overview

**Create a chat app where users can:**

  1. Log in using Replit authentication.
  
  2. View the last five messages posted in the chat room.
 
  3. Add their own messages.
 
  4. Each message should display the user's username and profile pic.
  
**Only your username will have admin privileges, allowing you to:**

   * See an "admin" button (visible only to you).
   
   * Delete any message from the board with a delete button.
   
   * Don’t worry about auto-refreshing the chat yet, we will save that for later challenges!
